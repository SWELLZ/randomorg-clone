# Welcome to my Random.org Clone!
## [LIVE SITE (unfinished)](https://randomorg-clone.netlify.app/)

### Introduction
This is a clone of Random.org that I am making for practice with React. I chose Random.org because I use it all the time to shuffle my Spotify playlist (their built in shuffle is terrible). I've noticed it's not as ✨ pretty ✨ as it could be and there's a few additions I'd like to make to make it's use a tiny bit faster. I will add a checklist of everything I'd like to do eventually because I am open to others contributing to this project. 

## Features
This site will be given features that demonstrate *true randomness* for the user. So far, the user can input a list of items and shuffle those items and connect their spotify account which will then shuffle a playlist directly.
